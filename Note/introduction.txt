1) DRF :- Django REST framework(DRF) is a powrful and flexible toolkit for building web API. DRF is based on django's class-based views.
2) API :- Application programming interface is a software intermediary that allows two or more applications to talk to each other.
	API Type in terms of release policies:-
	a) Private - It can be used within the organization.
	b) Partner - It can be used within Business partners.
	c) Public - It can be used any third party Developers.
3) Web API :- A web API is an application programming interface for the web.
3.1) REST :- Representational State Transfer (REST) refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring
			 about efficient, reliable and scalable systems. It is an architectural guideline to develop web API.

(REST resource as a librarian and the API as the language used to talk to them. )
3.2) REST API :- The API which is developed using REST is know as REST API or RESTfull API.

4) Serializer :- Serializer allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native python datatypes
		that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content.(complex data convert native python datatype)
	Python Json :- Python has a built in package called json, which is used to work with json data.
		a) dumps(data) : This is used to convert python object into json string.
		b) loads(data) : This is used to parse json string.(convert json to python object)

	 Complex Data ==>> Native python Datatype ==>> JSON data
				(Serializer)		(Render into Json)

	a} complex_Data = model_name.Objects.all()
	b} complex_to_nativePythonData = Serializer_name(complex_Data)
	c} native_to_JSONdata = JSONRenderer().render(complex_to_nativePythonData.data)

5) JOSN :- stands for javaScript Object Notation. Json is often used When data is sent from a server to a web page.
	Ex :- {"username":"aaa", "password":"1234"}

6) Deserialization :- The process of converting vative python datatypes such as dictionaries to complex data types 
	such as querysets is called deserialization. Serializers also provide deserialization, Allowing parsed
	data to be converted back into complex types, ager first validating the incoming data.
(parse data to convert complex data type)


	JSON data ==>> Native Python Datatype ==>> Complex datatype
			(parse data)		(deserialization)
	a) BytesIO() :- 
		import io
		stream = io.BytesIO(json_data)
	b) JSONParser() :- This is used to parse json data to python natice data type.
		from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser
		parsed_data = JSONParser().parse(stream)
	c) De-serialization :- paesed data to be converted into complex type.
		i) creating serializer object - serializer = serializer_name(data = parsed_data)
		ii) Validation check - seializer.is_valid()
			(serializer.validated_data / serializer.errors)

7) Validation :- There are three waye to write validation.
	a) Field Level Validation : We can specify custom field-level validation by adding
		validate_fieldName methods to your serializer subclass.
		This are similar to the clean_fieldName methods on Django forms.
		Return validated value or validationError.
		syntax:- def validate_fieldname(self, value) Where value is the field value that requires validation
		This Method is Automatically invoked or call when is_valid() method is called.
	b) Object Level Validation : When we need to do validation that requires access to multiple fields,
			we do object level validation by adding a method called validate() to serializer subclass.
			It raise a serializers. validationError if necessary, or just return the validated values.
			Syntax :- def validate(self, data), where data is a dictionary of field values.
	c) Validatiors :- Most of the time i dealing with Validation in REST framework i simply be relying
			on the default field va lidation. or writing explicit validation methods on serializer or field classes.
			However, sometimes i want to place i validation logic into resuable components, so that it can easily, 
			be reused throughtout i codebase. This can be achieved by using validator functions and validator classes.

		Priority - Validatiors > field level validator > object level validator.

8) ModelSerializer class : The ModelSerializer class provides a shotcut that lets you automatically create a 
		serializer class with fields that correspond to the Model fields.
		. It will automatically generate a set of fields for you, based on the model.
		. It will automatically generate validators for the serializer, such as unique_together validators.
		. It includes simple default implementations of create() and update().

		#class StudentSerializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
			#class Meta:
				#model = StudentModel
				#fields = ['student_name', 'class_name', 'age', 'roll']
				## fields = '__all__'  # Mean all fields in studentModel

9) APIView :-
	a) Function based APIView : This wrapper provide a few bits of functionality such as making sure you receive Request
			instances in your view, and adding context to Response objects so that content negotiation can be performed.
			.The wrapper also provide behaviour such as returning 405 Method Not Allowed responses when appropriate, and
			handling any ParseError exceptions that occur when accessing request.data with malformed input.
			.By default only GET method will be accepted. Other methods will respond with "405 Method Not Allowed"
				@api_view()

			. Example-
				@api_view(['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'])
				def function_name(request):
					...................
	
	b)Class based APIView : REST framework provides an APIView class, which subclass Django's view class.

10) GenericAPIView :- This class extends REST framework's APIView class, adding commonly required behavior for standard 
		list and detail views. 
		# Attributes --------
			queryset - The queryset that should be used for returning objects from this view. Typically, you must 
				either set this attribute, or override the get_queryset() method. If you are overriding a view method, 
				it is important that you call get_queryset() instead of accessing this property directly, as queryset will 
				get evaluated once, and those results will be cached for all subsequent requests. 

			serializer_class - The serializer class that should be used for validating and deserializing input, and for 
				serializing output. Typically, you must either set this attribute, or override the get_serializer_class() method.
			
			lookup_field - The model field that should be used to for performing object lookup of individual model instances. 
				Defaults to 'pk'. 

			lookup_url_kwarg - The URL keyword argument that should be used for object lookup. The URL conf should include 
				a keyword argument corresponding to this value. If unset this defaults to using the same value as lookup_field. 
			
			pagination_class - The pagination class that should be used when paginating list results. Defaults to the same 
				value as the DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS setting, which is 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination'. 
				Setting pagination_class=None will disable pagination on this view. 

			filter_backends - A list of filter backend classes that should be used for filtering the queryset. 
				Defaults to the same value as the DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS setting.
		
		
		# Methods -----------
			get_queryset(self) - It returns the queryset that should be used for list views, and that should be 
				used as the base for lookups in detail views. Defaults to returning the queryset specified by the 
				queryset attribute. This method should always be used rather than accessing self.queryset directly, 
				as self.queryset gets evaluated only once, and those results are cached for all subsequent requests.

			get_object(self) - It returns an object instance that should be used for detail views. Defaults to using the
				lookup_field parameter to filter the base queryset. 
				
			get_serializer_class(self) - It returns the class that should be used for the serializer. Defaults to returning 
				the serializer_class attribute.

			get_serializer_context(self) – It returns a dictionary containing any extra context that should be supplied 
				to the serializer. Defaults to including 'request', 'view' and 'format' keys. 
			
			get_serializer(self, instance=None, data=None, many=False, partial=False) – It returns a serializer instance. 
			
			get_paginated_response(self, data) – It returns a paginated style Response object. 
			
			paginate_queryset(self, queryset) - Paginate a queryset if required, either returning a page object, 
				or None if pagination is not configured for this view.

			filter_queryset(self, queryset) - Given a queryset, filter it with whichever filter backends are in use, returning a new queryset.


11) Mixins :-  
	. One of the big wins of using class-based views is that it allows us to easily compose reusable bits of behaviour. 
	. The create/retrieve/update/delete operations that we've been using so far are going to be pretty similar for any model-backed API views we create. 
	. Those bits of common behaviour are implemented in REST framework's mixin classes. 
	. The mixin classes provide the actions that are used to provide the basic view behavior. 
	. Note that the mixin classes provide action methods rather than defining the handler methods, 
		such as get() and post(), directly. This allows for more flexible composition of behavior. 
	. The mixin classes can be imported from rest_framework.mixins 

	. *There are Five mixins class -
		 • ListModelMixin • CreateModelMixin • RetrieveModelMixin • UpdateModelMixin • DestroyModelMixin

12) Concrete View Class :- 
	The following classes are the concrete generic views. 
	If you're using generic views this is normally the level you'll be working at unless you need heavily customized behavior. 
	The view classes can be imported from rest_framework.generics 
		• ListAPIView • CreateAPIView • RetrieveAPIView • UpdateAPIView • DestroyAPIView 
		• ListCreateAPIView • RetrieveUpdateAPIView · RetrieveDestroyAPIView · RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
	
13) ViewSet :- Django REST framework allows you to combine the logic for a set of related views in a single class, 
	called a ViewSet. 
	There are two main advantages of using a ViewSet over using a View class. 
		• Repeated logic can be combined into a single class. 
		• By using routers, we no longer need to deal with wiring up the URL conf ourselves.
	A ViewSet class is simply a type of class-based View, that does not provide any method handlers 
	such as get() or post(), and instead provides actions such as list() and create()
		. list() - Get All Records
		. retrieve) - Get Single Record 
		. create() Create/Insert Record 
		. update() - Update Record Completely 
		. partial_update() – Update Record Partially 
		. destroy() - Delete Record
	During dispatch, the following attributes are available on the ViewSet:- 
		• basename - the base to use for the URL names that are created. 
		• action - the name of the current action (e.g., list, create).
		• detail - boolean indicating if the current action is configured for a list or detail view. 
		• suffix - the display suffix for the viewset type - mirrors the detail attribute. 
		• name - the display name for the viewset. This argument is mutually exclusive to suffix. 
		• description - the display description for the individual view of a viewset.

14) ModelViewSet Class :- The ModelViewSet class inherits from GenericAPIView and includes implementations 
		for various actions, by mixing in the behavior of the various mixin classes. 
		. The actions provided by the ModelViewSet class are list(), retrieve(), create(), update(), partial_update(), and destroy(). 
			You can use any of the standard attributes or method overrides provided by GenericAPIView. 
			Example :-
				class StudentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet): 
					queryset = Student.objects.all() 
					serializer_class = StudentSerializer

15) ReadOnlyModelViewSet Class :- The ReadOnlyModelViewSet class also inherits from GenericAPIView. As with ModelViewSet it also includes 
		implementations for various actions, but unlike ModelViewSet only provides the 'read-only' actions, list() and retrieve(). 
		. You can use any of the standard attributes and method overrides available to GenericAPIView. 
		Example - 
			class StudentReadOnlyModelViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet): 
				queryset = Student.objects.all() 
				serializer_class = StudentSerializer
